# Advanced React and Redux - 2018

This is the code from the Advanced React course by Stephen Grider at
[Udemy]https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/learn/v4/overview)

## Progress

Begun section 3 - HOC

## Differences

I have done the Section 3 - HOC in a new directory valled HOC

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for almost 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
